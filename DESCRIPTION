Title: Fast, Low Memory Footprint Digests of R Objects
Description: Provides an R interface to Bob Jenkin's streaming, 
 non-cryptographic 'SpookyHash' hash algorithm for use in digest-based 
 comparisons of R objects. 'fastdigest' plugs directly into R's internal 
 serialization machinery, allowing digests of all R objects the serialize() 
 function supports, including reference-style objects via custom hooks. Speed is
 high and scales linearly by object size; memory usage is constant and 
 negligible.
